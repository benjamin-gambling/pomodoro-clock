# Pomodoro Clock

This project was completed as part of the Free Code Camps Front End Libraries Assignment.

This project was created using React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The aim of the project was to create a pomodoro clock that helps increase productivity by having regular timed breaks using a interval method. React was used to rerendered components all around the page as the timer decreased, changed and finished. A few other features were added to this to increase the functionality of the app and make it more user friendly.
